    <p>Started on <em>November 19th, 2002</em>, by GNU/Linux enthusiasts, the <strong>Beijing GNU/Linux User Group</strong> - aka <strong>BLUG</strong> - has now become a very influential group in the realm of GNU/Linux and Free and Open Source in China. We have attracted numerous community members, developers and staff of companies using or developing Linux and Open Source. We have also been rewarded with several titles of honor and awards for our contributions and efforts. Do take the time to browse our site to better understand what we have done in the past, what we're working on now and how to join us in our various activities.</p>
<p>It is now important to state that <strong>the BLUG is a Chinese and English speaking open-for-all non-profit organization promoting and supporting the Linux community</strong> in China.</p>
<p>We hold regular monthly meetings and membership is free.</p>
<p>The Beijing GNU/Linux User Group has as goals to:</p>
<ul>

<li>Provide education for those that wish to introduce Linux to their home or office</li>
<li>Offer support to those that are already using GNU/Linux</li>
<li>Create an inviting social environment for GNU/Linux discussions (see meetings )</li>
